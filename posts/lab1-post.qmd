In Lab 1, I was tasked with fully assembling the E155 protoboard and verifying the functionality of both the MCU and FPGA. Additionally, I was required to control a 7-segment display and some onboard LEDs using SystemVerilog via Lattice Radiant. This lab took me approximately 8 hours to complete.

After following the setup instructions from `resources/course_website/Lab 1`, I began planning my approach for the coding portion. I started with a block diagram outlining the SystemVerilog modules and signals I expected to implement. This step helped me stay organized and focused while writing the code.

For troubleshooting and debugging, I primarily used manual test cases to verify that the correct segments were turning on as expected. I also used a multimeter to check that the pins were behaving as intended. These steps allowed me to trace issues back to the software and debug the code effectively.

My design meets all the lab's requirements at an acceptable level. However, one improvement for the future is the accuracy of the oscillation for the onboard LED. Currently, I made the LED oscillate based on the 25th bit of the onboard high-speed oscillator (HSOSC), resulting in an approximate frequency of 2 Hz rather than the specified 2.4 Hz. To fix this, I would implement a second counter to track the exact number of oscillations from the HSOSC and adjust the LED to oscillate at precisely 2.4 Hz.

I particularly enjoyed learning Lattice Radiant, as it helped me reconnect with SystemVerilog concepts I had forgotten from E85.

Moving forward, I will be more meticulous about reviewing and commenting my code. My initial Verilog code lacked sufficient comments, leading to confusion within the submodules. This lab taught me valuable code management techniques that I will apply from the start of Lab 2.

## Technical Takeaways

### What to Remember
- Ensure that when assigning bits, they are prefaced by their respective size and base specifications.
- If you encounter issues, double-check that the hardware is functioning as expected to rule out potential malfunctions.

### For the Future
- Learn how to create and use a test bench.
