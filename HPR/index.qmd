# About
This post highlights my and [Jordan Stones](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jordan-stone-844a4b1b8/) final project in [E178: High Power Rocketry](https://pages.hmc.edu/spjut/AdvRoc/index.md.html), taught by [Prof. Erik Spjut](https://www.hmc.edu/about/news/experts/erik-spjut/). This course covered the modeling and design of a stable, reliable high-power rocket, along with construction techniques such as basic machining and the use of composite epoxies for joints and fillets. We also conducted analysis of flight data, sensor verification, and, in our case, implemented active roll control with live data acquisition and a PID feedback loop.

# Project Ideation
Our project search was kind of all over the place. We had thoughts of dual stage rockets, modal analysis, top speed, max height. Until we found that someone in a previous class attempted a "Gyro Stabilized" rocket, which resulted in the following comment. "Got the gyro to spin up, but it didn't seem to have much effect." - [HPR Website Under "Final Project"](https://pages.hmc.edu/spjut/AdvRoc/finalproject.md.html)

We determined that active roll control, using a motor-controlled flywheel and live data capture, would provide deeper insight into the rocket's rotational characteristics and enable better oversight of its control.

# Project Design
All design and implamentation, apart from the build instructions and already on board teensy 4.0 MCU provided by Prof. Spjut, was done by Jason and Jordan. The main effort of the mechanical design was for the support structure that would hold all of the electronics inside the avionics bay of the rocket. The digital design was mainly focused on communicaiton with a adafruit arduino QTpi and a teensy 4.0, and well as how to save data onto an SD card. The systems design was very simple, and used simple yet proven control calibration techniques to ensure desired function.

## Mechanical Design
The primary focus of the mechanical design was on creating a support structure to house all of the electronics. After determining which electronics needed to be placed in the avionics bay, we created models with the general shape of each component. These models were then added into an assembly, and the support structure was designed around them.
The main considerations for this design were strength and fit. Strength was crucial because the rocket would experience accelerations of up to 30Gs, and fit was equally important due to the limited space and our ambitious objectives.

Bringing an idea into flurission, in my experience, typically come with extra nick nacks and trinquets than I initially imagine.
