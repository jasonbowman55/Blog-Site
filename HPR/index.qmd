## About
This class was a thrilling rollercoaster experience during my junior year at Harvey Mudd College. In this post, I focus on the final project portion of the class, where Jordan Stone and I built a PID-controlled rotational stabilization system for a Level 2 high-power model rocket that reached an altitude of 3,000 meters. Throughout this project, I gained extensive knowledge in digital electronics, signal and data processing, control systems, mechanical design, project management, and rigorous testing procedures. I also learned that I really, really, really like to launch rockets and see if my creation can survive the 30G environments.

Bringing an idea into flurission, in my experience, typically come with extra nick nacks and trinquets than I initially imagine.
