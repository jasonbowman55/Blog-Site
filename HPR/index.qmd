# About

This class was a thrilling rollercoaster experience during my junior year at Harvey Mudd College. This page mainly focuses on the final project portion of the class, where Jordan Stone and I built a PID-controlled rotational stabilization system for a Level 2 high-power model rocket that reached an altitude of 3,000 meters. Throughout this project, I gained extensive knowledge in digital electronics, signal and data processing, control systems, mechanical design, project management, and rigorous testing procedures. I also learned that I really, really, really like to launch rockets and see if my creation can survive the flight environments.

# Project Ideation
Our project search was kind of all over the place. We had thoughts of dual stage rockets, modal analysis, top speed, max height. Until we found that someone in a previous class attempted a "Gyro Stabilized" rocket, which resulted in the following comment. "Got the gyro to spin up, but it didn't seem to have much effect." *-E178: High-Power Rocketry/Final Project* So we thought, what is stopping up from building a active control system in order to rotationally stabilize our rocket.

Bringing an idea into flurission, in my experience, typically come with extra nick nacks and trinquets than I initially imagine.
