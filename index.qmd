Hi, I am Jason Bowman. I am a Senior Engineering major at Harvey Mudd College, with a concentration in Russian language. I have technical experience with Embedded Systems Engineering, Mechanical Design and SolidWorks CAD design and simulation, and Control Systems to name a few.

This portfolio began as a means of displaying progress in a class called Micro Processor Application & Design (aka "Micro Ps").
