    "text": "Results & Reflection\nThe design meets all the lab requirements at an acceptable level. However, accuracy in the LED oscillation could be improved. Currently, the LED oscillates based on the 25th bit of the high-speed oscillator (HSOSC), resulting in an approximate frequency of 2 Hz instead of the specified 2.4 Hz. To address this, a second counter would be implemented to track the exact oscillations from the HSOSC and adjust the LED to precisely 2.4 Hz.\nI particularly enjoyed learning Lattice Radiant, as it helped me reconnect with SystemVerilog concepts I had forgotten from E85.\nMoving forward, I will be more meticulous about reviewing and commenting my code. My initial Verilog code lacked sufficient comments, leading to confusion within the submodules. This lab taught me valuable code management techniques that I will apply from the start of Lab 2."

As well as a functioning 5-bit LED display showing the binary combination of the two 4-bit inputs.\nThe counter variable, incremented by the internal clock signal (int_osc), controls the oscillation speed between two different 7-segment displays using a selector. While this provides adequate control for the current application, developing a more precise counter mechanism could further optimize performance and improve accuracy in future work.\nThis lab took approximately 13 hours to complete. Significant challenges were encountered early in the implementation stage, and using test benches could have helped reduce the time spent."
