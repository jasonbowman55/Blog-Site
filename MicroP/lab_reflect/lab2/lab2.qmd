## Intro & Design Approach
In this lab, a design was implemented on an FPGA to time-multiplex between two 7-segment displays, each showing separate values based on its own 4-bit binary input. Two simple transistor circuits were used to alternate between the respective 7-segment displays. Additionally, the design required the sum of these two 4-bit inputs to be displayed in binary on a 5-bit line of LEDs.

My design approach began with a block diagram, where I created a top module and two submodules: one controlled both 7-segment displays, and the other controlled the line of 5 independent LEDs.

### Block Diagram

In SystemVerilog, when programming the UPduino FPGA, a counter was used in conjunction with the on-board high-speed oscillator (HSOSC) to generate an internal clock signal named int_osc. This int_osc influenced the counter variable, and was then used to alternate between the displays and manage other internal logic. Combinational logic was subsequently implemented to handle the 7-segment display outputs. The oscillatory behavior of the int_osc signal was used to toggle the I/Os for each independent 7-segment display. A simple assign statement was used to generate the LED binary outputs.

## Results & Discussion
This lab resulted in a working time-multiplexed dual 7-segment display that coorectly displays hexidecimal digits 1-F independantly, clearly, and without bleeding. As well as a functioning 5-bit LED display showing the binary combination of the two 4-bit inputs.

The counter variable, incremented by the internal clock signal (int_osc), controls the oscillation speed between two different 7-segment displays using a selector. While this provides adequate control for the current application, developing a more precise counter mechanism could further optimize performance and improve accuracy in future work.

This lab took approximately 13 hours to complete. Significant challenges were encountered early in the implementation stage, and using test benches could have helped reduce the time spent.

## For The future
- Learn and implament test benches in order to miniimize time wasted
- Create a more clear and concise circuit schematic that is easier to follow when building the circuit.
