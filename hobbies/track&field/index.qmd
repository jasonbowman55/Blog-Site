title: THIS HOBBY HAS NOT BEEN FILLED OUT YET
draft: true

I began track and field during my 7th grade year. I have competed in track ever since, all the way through my college career, where I competed for Claremont McKenna track and field program, as a student at Harvey Mudd College.

# Why Sports
I began competing in sports at a very young age, starting with T-ball as soon as my parents could register me. Over the years, I played baseball for nine years (T-ball through 8th grade), American football for seven years (5th grade through 12th grade), and track & field for ten years (7th grade through my senior year of college). Through these experiences, I have not only gained a deep understanding of each sport but, more importantly, learned valuable lessons about myself, and how sports were able to facilitate those lessons.

Before making the following claim, I want to emphasize that I am not making a generalized or all-encompassing statement about sports and what they teach. While I believe these lessons and ways of thinking are common and apply to the majority of people involved in sports, I do not claim that they are a one-size-fits-all experience or guideline.

The freedom to make mistakes under pressure, accept failure, analyze its cause, find a solution, and refocus—all within a low-stakes environment—was one of the most valuable lessons I gained from sports, particularly in my early years playing baseball and football. The key to growth under pressure is experiencing that pressure in the first place. If my athletic experiences hadn't provided this, I would have missed a crucial opportunity to develop resilience.

It is this combination of being able to compete in a healthy way, work toward positive outcomes, and embrace challenges that make sports worth it from a young age. Baseball games, especially when I was just starting out, felt overwhelming and deeply significant in the moment. The pressure was real—people were watching, coaches were instructing, and every action reflected the effort I had put in. Learning to manage that stress and perform despite it shaped the way I handle challenges today, both on and off the field.



# Why Track?
Track is actually my most recent athletic passion. I played baseball for 9 years including T-ball through 8th grade. I also played American football for 7 years, starting in 5th grade and ending my senior year of high school, including a club team in middle school (we were pretty bad ass if I might say). Not to mention one measly year of basketball in 4th grade, where I had made the mistake of purchasing shoes far to big for my feet, ending my basketball career in a comically clown like trip in center court.

Though all of these sports besides track and field either exhibited aspects which I dispized, or had required interest for which I never held.

I loved baseball as a ptcher and first baseman. The pressure and individuality of being on the mound is something that I thrived in, and exhibits a similar feeling to thowing as a track & field athlete. I believe these experiences have helped shape my character from a young age. The freedom to fuck up while underpressure, accept the failure, assess the cause, remedy, and recenter your mind all within the confines of a non-consequential environment is something that I think all kids shouls experience, and is a large reason why I will advocate for kids in sports. It also teaches you how to be competitive, work for positive results, and enjoy a challenge. Baseball games, especially at first beginning and a young age, can feel overwhelming and extremely meaningful in the moment, which is key for its effect. These events were very stressful for me in the beginning, there are people watching, coaches telling you what to do, and your every move is a reflection of how hard you have prepared yourself. 


Though once highschool baseball came around I knew something was different. Maybe it was that I truly enjoyed track more at the time, and that hind sight is 20/20. But I do remember feeling a different energy from the staff and players when I met them in an attempt to do baseball and track at the same time. A level of politics that should never exist in a below professional athletic setting began to show. Parents were involved, coaches had their favorites, teammates fought and argued for playing time. I look back now with confidence that I made the corect decision in dropping baseball for track and field at that time. While I will never know what my highschool baseball career would have looked like, I have friends who I know loved the game orders of magnitude more than I, who began to hate the game.

- intro dunction
    - what I have played, who am I, when Iplayd sports
- Why do sports matter (to me)
    - the importance of physical activity (for me)
    - why the pressure of sports (the fact that they feel like a big thing in the moment but are actually really safe and non-sconsesquential environments is a good thing, and if sports did not feel stressful or scary in the moment then the whole lession behind them would be useless and futile) (and how it effected me mainly)
    - A bit about each of baseball football and track and how they providedd me the saces to learnt these lessons about myself and why that was impotant to me (maybe basketball as well lol)
- WHY TRACK?
    - This will go less into the philosophical lessons that you learn fromt the sports (or of what I learned) and more into why I stopped playing them ie(football was not intereted in the actual game just hitting people and baseball was oo political)
    - why is track good for me and why it is important to me
        - how it supports my hobby of being in the weight room
        - how it supports the mindset of being indivisualistic in sports and everything
        - why it is fund, and the fact tat all the teams chear for eachother in some cases because people just want to see eachother do good no matter what (which is similar to the concept and philosophy of lifint in the weight room)
        - the people that I have met and the experiences that I have had
