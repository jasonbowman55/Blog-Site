# Intro
Stemming from the challenge started by David Goggins called the 4x4x48, where one runs 4 miles, every 4 hours, for 48 hours. The video attached highlights the journey of [Ket Hollingsworth](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ket-hollingsworth/) and [Collin Fitzpatrick](https://www.linkedin.com/in/collin-fitzpatrick-2155a9222/) doing this challenge, putting their own spin on it.

# The Plan
Run 4 miles every 4 hours for 48 hours with the following 4 hour time breakdown:
- hour 0-1: Run 4 miles
- hour 1-3: learn something new / work on a project
- hour 3-4: sleep

# Situation / My Role
Collin and Ket, my roommates and close friends from day one at Harvey Mudd, wanted to take on something wild for spring break freshman year. We canâ€™t remember who first threw out the idea, but we were all instantly pumped to see how far we could take it. A mix of sleep deprivation, spending time together, and partaking in such a rediculous task, made for a very fun time. My job was to film and edit the final video, keep them on track, and come up with fun ways to wake them up every 4 hours. Good times.
