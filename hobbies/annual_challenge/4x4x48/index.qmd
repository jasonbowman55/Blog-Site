# Intro
Stemming from the challenge started by David Goggins called the 4x4x48, where one runs 4 miles, every 4 hours, for 48 hours. The video attached highlights the journey of [Ket Hollingsworth](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ket-hollingsworth/) and [Collin Fitzpatrick](https://www.linkedin.com/in/collin-fitzpatrick-2155a9222/) doing this challenge, putting their own spin on it.

# The Plan
Run 4 miles every 4 hours for 48 hours with the following 4 hour time breakdown:
- hour 0-1: Run 4 miles
- hour 1-3: learn something new / work on a project
- hour 3-4: sleep
