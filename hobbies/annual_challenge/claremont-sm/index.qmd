# Intro
Following up on our previous spring break adventure with the 4x4x48, we wanted to take on another fun and physically challenging journey. This time, I teamed up again with [Ket Hollingsworth](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ket-hollingsworth/) and [Collin Fitzpatrick](https://www.linkedin.com/in/collin-fitzpatrick-2155a9222/) to bike from Harvey Mudd to Santa Monica and back. Collin’s high school friend and sister both go to UCLA, so we planned to use it as a stopping point on our 2-day, 135-mile journey.

# The Plan
- Training: no training
- Equipment: Bikes, water?, bread?
- Sleeping: Thors floor
- Route: Harvey Mudd -> Cal Tech -> JPL -> UCLA -> Santa Monica Pier -> UCLA(sleep) -> Harvey Mudd

# Situation
Having done this kind of event last year, we knew it would be a fun experience. We started off a bit rough and unprepared—Collin had just finished a swimming event, Ket stepped on coral and took a 3-hour nap before we left, and I had sprained my ankle at practice the week before. However, nothing was going to stop us from doing Version 2 of our now annual tradition. We unexpectedly ended up getting an in-depth tour of LA County, experiencing the full range of highs and lows the city has to offer. It was truly an immersive experience, and I’d do it again in a heartbeat.
